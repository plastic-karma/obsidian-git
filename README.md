# Obsidian Git — Native Auth Fork

A powerful community plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) that brings Git integration right into your vault. Automatically commit, pull, push, and see your changes — all within Obsidian.

## Install this fork with BRAT

This fork of [Vinzent03/obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) leaves desktop authentication to your local Git installation. It does not install the upstream password-prompt script, force SSH askpass behavior, or write desktop password responses into your vault.

1. Install and enable **BRAT** from Obsidian's community plugins.
2. In BRAT, choose **Add beta plugin** and enter `plastic-karma/obsidian-git`.
3. Install the latest release and restart Obsidian. The plugin appears as **Git (Native Auth)**.

This is an in-place replacement: the plugin ID remains `obsidian-git`, preserving existing settings and command IDs. Disable an existing Git installation before adding this fork; do not uninstall it if you want to keep its settings. Let BRAT manage updates for this plugin, rather than updating Git from the community catalog, which would replace the fork with upstream.

Git must already be installed and authentication configured for the vault's remote. Existing credential helpers (including Git Credential Manager, `gh`, and OS keychains), SSH agents and externally configured askpass programs remain in control. The plugin does not start a login shell: Obsidian must inherit the relevant environment, especially `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`. If necessary, launch Obsidian from the working terminal session or use the plugin's existing additional PATH/environment settings. Do not put secrets in those settings.

Without a working helper or agent, Git reports an authentication error instead of opening a plugin password modal. Terminal prompting defaults to disabled because Obsidian has no interactive terminal; an explicit `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT` setting is preserved.

**Desktop only:** this authentication change applies to Windows, macOS and Linux. Mobile still uses upstream's isomorphic-git backend and its existing credential handling; it cannot run local Git. See the fork's [authentication guide](docs/Authentication.md) for details.

## 📚 Documentation

All setup instructions (including mobile), common issues, tips, and advanced configuration can be found in the 📖 [full documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc).

> Mobile users: The plugin is **highly unstable ⚠️ !** Please check the dedicated [Mobile](#-mobile-support-%EF%B8%8F--experimental) section below.

> For detailed file history, consider pairing this plugin with the [Version History Diff](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-version-history-diff) plugin.

## UI Previews

### 🔧 Source Control View

Manage your file changes directly inside Obsidian, including staging and unstaging individual files and committing them. The main Commit action commits staged changes when present. If nothing is staged, the `Stage all changes when nothing is staged` setting determines whether all changes are staged and committed. The actions menu provides explicit staged-only and all-changes alternatives, plus amending the previous commit on desktop.

### 📜 History View

Show the commit history of your repository. The commit message, author, date, and changed files can be shown. Author and date are disabled by default as shown in the screenshot, but can be enabled in the settings.

### 🔍 Diff View 

Compare versions with a clear and concise diff viewer.
Open it from the source control view or via the `Open diff view` command.

### 📝 Signs in the Editor

View line-by-line changes directly in the editor with added, modified, and deleted line/hunk indicators. You can stage and reset changes right from the signs. There also commands to navigate between hunks and stage/reset hunks under the cursor. Needs to be enabled in the plugin settings.

## 💻 Desktop Notes

### 🔐 Authentication

Desktop authentication uses your existing Git configuration. Refer to this fork's [Authentication Guide](docs/Authentication.md).

### Obsidian on Linux

- ⚠️  Snap is not supported due to its sandboxing restrictions.
- ⚠️  Flatpak is not recommended, because it doesn't have access to all system files. They are actively fixing many issues, but there are still issues. Especially with more advanced setups.
- ✅ Please use AppImage or a full access installation of your system's package manager instead ([Linux installation guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Installation#Linux))

## 📱 Mobile Support (⚠️  Experimental)

The Git implementation on mobile is **very unstable**! I would not recommend using this plugin on mobile, but try other syncing services.

One such alternative is [GitSync](https://github.com/ViscousPot/GitSync), which is available on both Android and iOS. It is not associated with this plugin, but it may be a better option for mobile users. A tutorial for setting it up can be found [here](https://viscouspotenti.al/posts/gitsync-all-devices-tutorial).

> 🧪 The Git plugin works on mobile thanks to [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/), a JavaScript-based re-implementation of Git - but it comes with serious limitations and issues. It is not possible for an Obsidian plugin to use a native Git installation on Android or iOS.

### ❌ Mobile Feature Limitations

- No **SSH authentication** ([isomorphic-git issue](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/231))
- Limited repo size, because of memory restrictions
- No rebase merge strategy
- No submodules support

### ⚠️ Performance Caveats

> [!caution]
> Depending on your device and available free RAM, Obsidian may
>
> - crash on clone/pull
> - create buffer overflow errors
> - run indefinitely.
>
> It's caused by the underlying git implementation on mobile, which is not efficient. I don't know how to fix this. If that's the case for you, I have to admit this plugin won't work for you. So commenting on any issue or creating a new one won't help. I am sorry.

### Tips for Mobile Use:

If you have a large repo/vault I recommend to stage individual files and only commit staged files.
